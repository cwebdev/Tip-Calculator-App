## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It is beneficial to create mobile first design and then move towards desktop design providing responsive styling using CSS media query.

### Continued development

Would want to work more on CSS flexbox and also explore more frameworks like Next.js.
