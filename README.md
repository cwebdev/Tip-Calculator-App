## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- It is beneficial to create mobile first design and then move towards desktop design providing responsive styling using CSS media query.
- HTML input tag with number type allows '-' and 'e' signs by default. Disable them if not needed in project


### Continued development

Would want to work more on CSS flexbox and also explore more frameworks like Next.js.
